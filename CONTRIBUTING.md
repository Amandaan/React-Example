# Contributing

**Before we start any contributions, we will first select a design. Please go to [this discussion](https://github.com/DandyLyons/React-Example/discussions/3) to help pick a design.** 

**Steps to Contributing**
1. Please send me a link to your GitHub profile via a DM in our Slack. After you do so, I'll register you as a *Participant*.
2. Only pull requests from *Participants* will be merged. 
3. After you have at least 1 successful pull request merged, you will be considered a *Contributor* and you will be listed on our *Contributors* page. (Please don't stop at just 1 though. We want this project to be something you all can be proud of.)

## The Contributing Process
*Please be patient as this is my first time maintaining a repo with contributors. These processes are designed to make contributions as simple and enjoyable as possible. However, we may find that they need to be refined over time. If you have feedback, please share it in a [Discussion](https://github.com/DandyLyons/React-Example/discussions)*. 

1. Before making any pull request please look through the [Issues](https://github.com/DandyLyons/React-Example/issues). Do NOT work on an Issue unless it has been assigned to you. (This is to help prevent people from wasting time redoing work.) 
2. When you see an Issue you would like to work on, please comment that you would like to work on that Issue and I will start assigning pairs to work on each Issue. 
3. On your forked clone create a new branch with the name `feature/1-issue-name`. See *Branches and PRs* on this page.

### Pair Programming
*How will pair programming work?*

Pair programming isn't strictly necessary for this project, but **I will give preference to assigning Issues to pairs over individuals.** This is for a few reasons: 

1. Pair programming is a vital Software Development skill that is in high demand, and we could use the practice. 
2. I believe two are better than one. Your pair can help you problem solve and get unstuck faster. 

Before requesting to be assigned to an Issue, please find a pair, then one of you, (the *liaison*) should request the Issue to be assigned to both of you. 

I will only assign an Issue to an individual if, no pair can be found. 

**Roles**
During the course of pair programming you will have a "Driver" and a "Navigator". Please feel free to switch these roles as often as you would like. 

One person will be designated the *liaison*. This person is the one who will push the commit, and create the pull request. They will also be the point of contact for the Issue.

Each pair will work out amongst yourselves how/when you would like to work and who will be the *liaison*. 


## [Branches and PRs](https://github.com/mikaelacaron/Basic-Car-Maintenance/blob/dev/CONTRIBUTING.md#branches-and-prs)

- No commits should be made to the `main` branch directly. The `main` branch shall only consist of the deployed code
- Developers are expected to work on feature branches, and upon successful development and testing, a PR (pull request) must be opened to merge with `dev`
- Use kebab-case for branch names ✅ **Examples of valid branch names:**
    - 8123-fix-title-of-issue (issue number)
    - 8123-feature-name (issue number)

❌ **Examples of invalid branch names**:

- username-testing
- attemptToFixAuth
- SomethingRandom

## Coding Style Guidelines
Developers should aim to write clean, maintainable, scalable and testable code.
